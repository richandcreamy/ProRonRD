Exercises related to the Professional Ruby on Rails Developer with Rails 5 Udemy course. First Ruby Assignment, Blurbalizer, and shakey files are all related to going through the https://try.ruby-lang.org/ (On Github as https://github.com/ruby/TryRuby) lessons in VS Code instead of the web IDE.

If anyone is searching for how to format all of William Shakespeare's work as a Ruby hash with him as an author, hopefully they'll see this so I can tell them to use the JSON from https://github.com/ruby/TryRuby/blob/master/shakespeare.json and then use JSON.parse to do the work for you.

Eventually I'll add more files here that I'll be creating while going through this course https://www.udemy.com/course/pro-ruby-on-rails-rails5/ unless I create new repository instead.
